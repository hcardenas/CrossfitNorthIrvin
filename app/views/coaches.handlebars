						<hr>
						<h6>CrossFit Level 1 Trainer/ Owner</h6>
						<h6>CrossFit Gymnastics Certified</h6>
						<p>After 20 years of playing competitive team sports, Chris found the sport of CrossFit in 2011 and was hooked from the start.  He was immediately drawn to the individuality of the sport while sill connecting with the team spirit that the CrossFit community embraces.  In addition,  Chris is driven by the physical and mental endurance that he has gained since beginning CrossFit.  Mostly though, he is inspired by watching the confidence of his students change from an "I can't" to an "I can do anything!" attitude. </p>
